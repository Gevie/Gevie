### Hi there, I'm Stephen aka Gevie 👋

I'm a full stack developer mainly specialising in websites and apps. I created my first
website at 12 years old for fun and have been actively developing things for the last
21 years. 

Most of my work is proprietary, unfortunately you will not see it here.

I also have many years experience as a website and graphic designer however I feel it's important
to focus on development as a speciality and leave design / ux to the professionals wherever possible.

My main backend language throughout my career has been PHP.

### ⚡ Employment

I'm currently seeking full time or contract employment.

### 🔭 Current Projects

I'm working on a few public python projects as a way of learning the language for fun.

**AnnounceBotTwitch**

A discord bot which allows those with permission to assign (CRUD) a twitch channel to server members, the assignment
may also include any number of server roles. When the bot detects the twitch channel has started to stream, it will tag 
the assigned roles in a designated channel to inform anyone following said roles their favourite streamer is streaming.

This is my first python project and is currently a work in progress.

**SimplePythonGame**

As I'm learning python, I am also teaching a good friend of mine how to improve his python skills as well as teaching 
him design patterns, best practices and git. My friend is a bioengineering and computer science student.

I was approached on how to make a game for an upcoming research experiment, some misunderstanding
lead to me believing the deadline was within 24 hours (it was 8 days), I offered to make the game element so he could 
concentrate on the recording side. 

Now that the project has been completed to a stage where it works well enough for the experiment, this repository has 
transformed into a teaching platform for my friend, in the coming weeks or months I'll be using it as a basis for my 
friend to put to action feedback and learning material as well as fixing bad practices until the end product is something
which could be used by anybody and is of a much higher quality.
